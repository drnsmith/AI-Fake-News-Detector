## **Project Overview**
This AI system provides **real-time misinformation detection** by analysing articles, blogs, and social media content using NLP and AI-driven credibility checks.

- **AI-Powered Fact-Checking** (GPT-4o, LangChain)  
- **Social Media Scraping** (Twitter, Reddit, News APIs)  
- **Bias & Sentiment Analysis** (NLP-based heuristics)  
- **Graph-Based Propagation Analysis** (Misinformation spread tracking)  
- **API & UI for Real-Time Use** (Gradio/FastAPI)

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Fake News Detection**: Evaluate article credibility instantly.  
- **AI-Powered Fact-Checking**: Cross-checks with verified sources.  
- **Bias & Sentiment Analysis**: Understand the tone & political bias of content.  
- **Graph-Based Spread Analysis**: Maps misinformation propagation over networks.  
- **User-Friendly API & UI**: Deploy with minimal effort.
